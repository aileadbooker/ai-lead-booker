---

To execute a task using the 3-layer architecture:

1. Read relevant directives in `directives/`.
2. Locate or create required scripts in `execution/`.
3. Set necessary environment variables in `.env`.
4. Run scripts to perform the work, storing any intermediate data in `.tmp/`.
5. If errors occur, fix the execution scripts and update the directives.
6. Provide the final deliverable to the user, typically via a cloud service or final report.
